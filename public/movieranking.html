<h3>A Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p>
    A Clockwork Orange follows the leader of a small gang through a dystopian future. 
    It's delightfully disturbing and jarring.

<h3>Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>
    A scrappy archeaologist goes on an adventure through the desert to find the Ark of the
    Covenant before the Nazi's do.
</p>
<h3>War Dogs</h3>
<p>
    Two young men enter the exciting industry of arms dealing and get up to some silly hijinks.
